            Your sub-headline should supplement the headline by offering a brief description of what you do or what you offer. 
            This can be done effectively by zeroing in on a common pain point that your product or service solves.
            Here's an example of a great sub-headline from Mirror: "Hiding in plain sight." 
            It hones in on the primary selling point of the mirror gym: Itâ€™s a full at-home gym, personal trainer, 
            and workout plan all in the comfort of your home without taking up precious square footage with equipment.
